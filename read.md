# Exercise 7
​
This might sound familiar if you did exerise 5...
Write a fantasy game character creator version 2!
​
- Create a public repository on your GitHub profile or clone an existing one
- Clone it and add these instructions as README.md
- Create a new file called `phantasy.py`
- Ask the user how many characters to create
- Ask the user for character names, one for each character
- A character will randomly be a Barbarian, Cleric or Druid
- Each character has stats: Health, Strength, Magic and Initiative
- Each stat is random, between 3 and 15
- Barbarians will have triple Strength and Health
- Clerics will have triple Magic and Initiative
- Druids will have double Health, Magic and Initiative
- Generate the team of however many characters the user wanted
- **Use at least one function**
​
Example of program output below.
